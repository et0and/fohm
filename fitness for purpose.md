Fitness for purpose describes how well a [[product]] works in the situation it was designed for and how well it meets the needs of its intended end-users. In order to ensure that a product is fit for its purpose, its designer has to find the right balance between technical factors and the needs of those who will be using the product. For example, a simple 'no frills' video player may better meet the needs of many users who would be overwhelmed by a sophisticated player with many additional features.

Fitness for purpose depends on accurate design specifications; if the specifications aren't right, then even if the product meets them completely, it still won't be fit for its purpose. Given accurate specifications, the designer then has to make appropriate choices in materials, assembly methods, and so on in order to ensure that the final product meets or surpasses the specifications. In developing solutions, designers need to continually evaluate their design decisions against their brief and specifications.
