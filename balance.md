There are three main kinds of visual balance:

- [[radial]], where the design elements radiate out from a centre, as in the petals of a daisy or the face of a clock;
- [[symmetry | formal]] (or symmetrical), where the design on one side of a centre line is identical to the other side, as in the front view of an animal or a chair;
- [[symmetry | informal]] (or asymmetrical), where the elements of a design are distributed unequally, as in the side view of a teapot.
