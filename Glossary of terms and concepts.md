**General Terms**

[[Aesthetic Principles]] - Relate to the way an object looks, it's appearance, style etc. It is the set of principles concerned with the qualities of appearance, visual appeal, good taste, and beauty and the rules that determine how beautiful or pleasing to the eye something is. Design elements within this principle include [[shape]], [[form]], [[colour]], [[texture]], [[finish]], [[environment]], [[point]], [[line]], [[plane]], [[size | proportion]], [[contrast]], [[pattern]], [[movement]], [[balance]], [[harmony]], [[style]], and [[rhythm]].

[[Developing a design idea | Ideation]] - Involves initiating, exploring and refining design ideas, informed by research, which leads to the communication of an outcome in response to a brief.

[[Exploration of design idea]] - The divergent aspect of [[idea generation]] and the development of an idea to create a wide group of possibilities.

[[Form]] - Refers to an objectâ€™s shape and surface qualities giving a 3 dimensional aspect to the object.  Examples of surface qualities relate to the [[materiality]]; [[colour]], [[texture]] and [[finish]] of the object. It is an object which has, or appears to have, three dimensional volume and solidity.

[[Function Principles]] - Relate to the operation, construction of the object (ie what makes it work). It is how a [[product]], [[system]], or [[environment]] works or performs for its intended use or user; how something carries out its purpose. Key elements include [[strength]], [[strength | durability]], [[efficiency]], [[safety]], [[safety | stability]], [[reliability]], [[ergonomic fit]], [[construction]] (and its [[cost]]), [[optimisation]], [[user-friendliness]], and [[fitness for purpose]].

[[Graphics Practice]] - Involves expressing a [[visual literacy]] through the development of a design idea by applying design and [[visual communication techniques]] and knowledge. 

[[Refining a design idea]] - The convergent aspect of developing an idea or ideas where the detail of the design solution is investigated in order to come up with a [[solution]] that has potential to work and meet the design brief.

[[Rendering techniques]] - Things like [[highlights]], [[reflections]] and [[shadow]] used to enhance the [[tonal change]] and 3 dimensional nature of the object.

[[Shape]] - Refers to an object's two-dimensional qualities.

[[Visual literacy]] - Refers to the visual modes (eg drawing, model-making, digital modelling) used as tools for aiding [[design thinking]].

**Architectural Terms**

[[Buttress]] - Reinforced, projecting wall, usually on the exterior of a building, supporting it at a point of stress. A flying buttress transmits the thrust of a vault to an outer support; see vault construction. 

[[Cantilever]] - A beam supported or fixed at one end carrying a load at the other.

[[Eave]] - Lower edge of a roof, overhanging a wall.

**Graphics Design Terms**

[[Alignment]] - The placement of images and components of the presentation so that they line up along an [[axis]], [[border]] or [[common centre]].

[[Composite image]] - A composite image is a [[graphic image]] (or photograph), made up of a combination of images.

[[Contour]] - The outline of an object.

[[Contrast]] - Contrast of [[colour]], [[shape]], [[size]], [[space]], [[scale]] creates visual attraction, different shapes can be used to  provide contrast in a [[composition]]. Similar shapes may not be as visually appealing.

[[Emphasis]] - Exists where an [[element]] or elements within a composition contain a [[hierarchy]] of visual importance.

[[Focal point]] - The visual point/centre of interest in a [[composition]]. Visual elements and principles are used to direct the viewer's eye to this point or [[perspective]].

[[Kerning]] - Adjusting the lateral (horizontal) space between letters.

[[Leading]] - The vertical spacing (measured in points) between lines of text.

[[Line]] - Any [[mark]] connecting any two separate points. It can organise, direct, separate or suggest [[emotion]] in a design.

[[Space | Negative and positive space]] - Images appearing on the page [[surface]] are [[positive]], whilst anything appearing further back in space is [[negative]]. Can be referred to as [[white space]] ie the space between objects in a [[composition]].

[[Opacity]] - The density of a colour or [[tonal value]]. The opacity of an image or object can range from transparent (0% opacity) to opaque (100% opacity). The ability to edit the opacity of individual objects allows the designer to create images that seem to flow into and through one another.

[[Proximity]] - The placement of elements in relation to each other in a [[composition]]. Elements that are close together are perceived to be more related than those are more widely spaced apart.

[[Repetition]] - Repetition of [[shape | shapes]], [[colour]], [[texture]], [[size]] etc in a [[composition]] which can be used to strengthen the presentation, develop the organisation of the image and make the presentation more unified.

[[Saturation]] - The [[colour]] intensity of an image. A colour with high saturation will appear brighter and more vibrant than the same colour with low saturation. Colours in grayscale images have no saturations (white, grays and black).

[[Shape | Shapes]] - Anything that has height and width. Shapes define objects, attract attention, communicate ideas and add excitement.

[[Similarity]] - Condition of [[element | elements]] within the [[composition]] being visually grouped according to features, [[contour | contours]] or [[symmetry | symmetries]]. 

[[Space]] - The distance or area between or around things. Separates or [[unity | unifies]] highlights and gives the eye a visual rest.

[[Texture]] - The look and feel of a [[surface]], adds richness and [[dimension]], emphasises and suggests mood or feeling.

[[Tonal value]] - The darkness or lightness of an area. Value separates, suggests mood, adds drama and creates the illusion of depth.

[[Vanishing point]] - The fixed point on the horizon where the [[perspective]] lines meet.
