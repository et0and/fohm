Ergonomics is the study of the relationship between people and their working [[environment]], especially in connection with the things they use. To achieve the best possible ergonomic fit, designers have to ensure that equipment and work environments match the capacities and limitations of their users. For example, the height of a table or the size and shape of a toothbrush are decided using ergonomic principles.

Ergonomics relates to the whole working environment, but an important focus is often the [[size]] and [[shape]] of objects. Designing objects that take account of people's size and shape requires the use of sets of standardised body measurements called anthropometric data, which can vary from country to country. These measurements are incorporated into the design of objects that will be used by many people, such as spectacles, cups, and public seating.
